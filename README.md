Hi! My name is Dante Culaciati, I'm from Buenos Aires, Argentina, and I'm a Computer Science student at the Faculty of Natural and Exact Sciences of the University of Buenos Aires.

Here you will find some of my personal projects. There's not much to brag about, but I believe that if you read through my code, you can get a general sense of how I like to carry out this sort of tasks.

If, for any reason, you wish to contact me, you can do so at: danteculaciati@gmail.com.
